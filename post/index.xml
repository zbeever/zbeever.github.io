      <title>The prisoner problem (no, not that one)</title>

      <description>During her Master&amp;rsquo;s program, my girlfriend signed up for a Putnam Competition preparation course. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a background in math, but she thought it would be fun&amp;mdash;and it was! There were lots of interesting practice problems we solved together and this was my favorite.
Prerequisites: To understand this post, you should have some knowledge of modular arithmetic.
Recommended Reading: The Putnam Competition website.
The setup Imagine a room with \(N\) prisoners. They are going to play a game for their freedom. They can talk amongst themselves and come up with a strategy before the game starts, but as soon as it begins they are immobile and unable to communicate.</description>

      <title>The evolving Harris current sheet model</title>

      <description>In many space physics papers investigating nonadiabatic current sheet scattering, the simplified Harris model is used. In Cartesian coordinates, it takes on the form
$$\mathbf{B} = B_x\tanh\Big(\frac{z}{L}\Big)\hat{\mathbf{i}} + 0\hat{\mathbf{j}} + B_z\hat{\mathbf{k}}$$
where \(L\) parameterizes the current sheet thickness. This is nice approximation for a relatively static magnetosphere, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture a thinning current sheet. For that, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to make the change \(L=L(t)\). In turn, this will induce an electric field. What is the expression for that field?
Prerequisites: To understand this post you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be familiar with Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations. To understand the motivation of this post, familiarity with basic space plasma physics and the structure of the magnetosphere is necessary.</description>

      <description>Recently, a friend of mine shared with me the idea of the Leibniz isochronous curve. In words, this is the trajectory a frictionless object would follow if its vertical velocity was left unchanged by a constant, downward force. Using the standard \(x\)-\(y\) Cartesian axes, the curve is parameterized by
$$\begin{aligned}x &amp;amp;= x(t)\\y &amp;amp;= -v_0t\end{aligned}$$
where \(v_0\) is positive. What is the exact expression for \(x(t)\)?
Prerequisites: To understand this post you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be comfortable with the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics.
