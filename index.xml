      <description>In many space physics papers investigating nonadiabatic current sheet scattering, the simplified Harris model is used. In Cartesian coordinates, it takes on the simple form
$$\mathbf{B} = B_x\tanh\Big(\frac{z}{L}\Big)\hat{\mathbf{i}} + 0\hat{\mathbf{j}} + B_z\hat{\mathbf{k}}$$
where \(L\) parameterizes the current sheet thickness. This is nice approximation for a relatively static magnetosphere, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture a thinning current sheet. For that, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to make the change \(L=L(t)\). In turn, this will induce an electric field. What is the expression for that field?
Prerequisites: To understand this post you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be familiar with Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations. To understand the motivation of this post, familiarity with basic space plasma physics and the structure of the magnetosphere is necessary.</description>

      <description>Recently, a friend of mine shared with me the idea of the Leibniz isochronous curve. In words, this is the trajectory a frictionless object would follow if its vertical velocity was left unchanged by a constant, downward force. Using the standard \(x\)-\(y\) Cartesian axes, the curve is parameterized by
$$\begin{aligned}x &amp;amp;= x(t)\\y &amp;amp;= -v_0t\end{aligned}$$
where \(v_0\) is positive. What is the exact expression for \(x(t)\)?
Prerequisites: To understand this post you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be comfortable with the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Master&amp;rsquo;s student in electrical engineering at Boston University where I work in a lab studying the physics of the near-Earth space environment. Prior to this, I graduated from Boston Conservatory with an undergraduate degree in music composition and worked as a composer for video games, most notably Project Zomboid. I&amp;rsquo;ve also interned at Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory, where I focused on modeling electron transport in liquid argon time projection chambers with unusual anode geometries.
Most of my free time is spent thinking about physics, engineering, and computer graphics. I have many notes on topics within these fields with perspectives I wish had been shared with me while I was learning.</description>
