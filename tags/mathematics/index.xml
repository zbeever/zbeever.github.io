      <description>During her Master&amp;rsquo;s program, my girlfriend signed up for a Putnam Competition preparation course. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a background in math, but she thought it would be fun&amp;mdash;and it was! There were lots of interesting practice problems we solved together and this was my favorite.
Prerequisites: To understand this post, you should have some knowledge of modular arithmetic.
Recommended Reading: The Putnam Competition website.
The setup Imagine a room with \(N\) prisoners. They are going to play a game for their freedom. They can talk amongst themselves and come up with a strategy before the game starts, but as soon as it begins they are immobile and unable to communicate.</description>
